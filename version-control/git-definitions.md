# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
	* version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It's useful because it allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	* A branch is a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. When you commit in Git, Git stores a commit object that contains a pointer to the snapshot of the content you staged. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	* A commit basically records changes to the repository. A good commit message is on that is concise and consistent. It is a meaningful message on what kind of update or changes you made to the file/repository. 
* What is a merge conflict?
	* It occurs when you're changing the same file. If two people changed the same lines in that same file, or if one person decided to delete it while the other person decided to modify it, Git simply cannot know what is correct and will then mark the file as having a conflict.
