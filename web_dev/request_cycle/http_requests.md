# How the Web Works

1. What are some common HTTP status codes?
  * Some common HTTP status codes are:
    200 OK Status Code - meaning the request has succeeded. The information returned with
    the response is dependent on the method used in the request.

    300 Multiple Choices - The requested resource has different choices and cannot be
    resolved into one.

    400 Bad Request - The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax. The client should not repeat the request without modifications.

    500 Internal Server Error - The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request.

  * These are just some common examples of HTTP status codes and there are many more that can be divulged into.
